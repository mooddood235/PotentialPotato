# PotentialPotato

Potential Potato is a dependantly typed programming language based on [Pie](https://github.com/the-little-typer/pie). It extends [Pie](https://github.com/the-little-typer/pie) with [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching), [recursive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)), and a universe hierarchy.

# Type checking 
Type checking is done using [bidirection type checking](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bidirectional+typechecking). Bidirectional type checking is a type checking strategy in which an expression `e` can be determined to be of type `E` through a combination of checking and synthesis operations. 

$e \implies E$ means we can sythensize the type $E$ given $e$. 

$e \impliedby E$ means the check that $e$ is of type $E$ is successful.

$\dfrac{\Gamma,x:A \vdash M \Leftarrow B}{\Gamma\vdash (\lambda x.M) \Leftarrow (A\to B)}$ tells us that if $x$ is of type $A$, and the check that $M$ is of type $B$ is successful, then checking that $(\lambda (x) M)$ is a function that takes an $A$ and returns a $B$ will be successful. 

$\dfrac{\Gamma\vdash f \Rightarrow (A\to B) \qquad \Gamma\vdash a \Leftarrow A }{\Gamma \vdash f(a) \Rightarrow B}$ tells us that if $f$ sythesizes to a function that takes an $A$ and returns a $B$, and checking that $a$ is an $A$ is successful, then synthesizing $f$ applied to $a$ gives a $B$. 

# Normalization
Expression normalization in Potential Potato is done using [normalization by evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalisation_by_evaluation). Potential Potato evaluates expressions into meta-level data structures (in our case Racket structures). They can be converted back into Potential Potato syntax using a read-back function. Normalization is done through a combination of evaluation and reading back. For example, to normalize a lambda function, it is evaluated into a `Closure` structure, which contains the body of the function, along with current environment extended with the function's argument. The function can be normalized by reading back:

1. Take the argument that is in the enviromnent `x` and put `Î» (x)` on the top.
2. Evaluated the body of the lambda function, then read the body back.

The result is the normalized lambda expression.

# Pattern Matching
```racket
(match E-in E-out e
  [pat_0 result_0]
  [pat_1 result_1]
  ...
  [!else result_else])
```
Returns the first `result_n` where `e` matches with the pattern `pat_n`. Tokens from `e` can be bound within a case using `!`. For example,
```racket
(match ... some-list
  ...
  [(:: !e !es) !es]
  ...)
```
Matches `some-list` to any list of the form `(:: head tail)` and returns the tail.

To ensure program correctness: 
- `e` must be of type `E-in`.
- Every `result_n` must be of type `E-out`.
- An "else" case must exist that always matches.

These restrictions ensure that the type of a match expression can be synthesized and checked, and that the match expression will always evaluate to a defined and predictable expression.

# Recursive Functions
```racket
(define rec-fib
  (the (Pi ((n Nat)) Nat)
    (lambda (n)
      (match Nat Nat n
        [zero zero]
        [(add1 zero) (add1 zero)]
        [(add1 (add1 !n)) (+ (rec-fib !n) (rec-fib (add1 !n)))]
        [!else !else]))))      
```
Is a recursive function that computes the `n`'th member of the Fibonacci sequence. In order to classify as a recursive function:
- The name of the definition must have prefix `rec-`.
- The bottom of the recursive function must be a match expression.
- The expression being matched must be the last argument to the recursive function.

Gauranteeing Termination:
Let `m` be the expression being matched. For every match case, the pattern is a more informative version of `m`. This means a strict sub-expression of the pattern is a strict sub-expression of `m`. Potential Potato restricts the last argument of every recursive call to be a strict sub-expression of the pattern. Hence, the last argument of every recursive call is a strict sub-expression of `m`. Since the last argument of every recursive function is what will be matched, we know that every recursive call is matching an expression that is a strict sub-expression of whatever the parent call was matching. Since every recursive call is matching a strictly smaller expression, and these exists an "else" case that always matches, the recursive function must terminate.

# Universe Heirarchy

$(U \ zero)$ takes the place of $U$ in Pie.
The main rules for type subsumption are:

$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash n \in Nat \leadsto n^{\circ}}{\Gamma \vdash (U \ n)\ type \ \leadsto (U \ n^{\circ})}$, The type $(U \ n)$ is introduced where $n$ is a Nat.

$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash expr \in (U \ n) \ \leadsto \ expr^{\circ}}{\Gamma \vdash expr \in (U \ (add1 \ n)) \ \leadsto \ expr^{\circ}}$ This indicates that $(U \ n)$ is a subtype of $(U \ (add1 \ n))$, in the following statements, the symbol $\subset$ will be used for subtype.

$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash n \in \mathbb{Nat} \leadsto n^{\circ}}{\Gamma \vdash \ (U \ n) \in (U \ (add1 \ n)) \ \leadsto \ (U \ n^{\circ})}$ This says that $(U \ n)$ typchecks as a $(U \ (add1 \ n))$. So its both a subtype and an element of $(U \ (add1 \ n))$.

$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash expr \in (U \ n) \ \leadsto \ expr^{\circ}}{\Gamma \vdash \ expr \in (U \ infty) \ \leadsto \ expr^{\circ}}$ Which says that $(U n)$ is a subtype of $(U \ infty)$. It is also the case that $(U \ n) \in (U \ infty)$ for any Nat $n$.

Note: $infty$ is a special Nat that is used for checking types and expressions when running code in the backend, but it should not be used when writing in PotentialPotato.

# More on Subtyping
This subtyping behavior also extends to functions and other similar objects like Pair, 

$\Gamma \vdash (\Pi \ ((m \ D)) \ K) \ type \ \leadsto \ s$

$\Gamma \vdash \ p \in (\Pi \ ((n \ A)) \ B) \ \leadsto \ p^{\circ}$

$\Gamma \vdash A \subset D \ \leadsto \ A^{\circ} $

$\dfrac{\Gamma,a:A ~ m:D \ \vdash B \subset K \leadsto B^{\circ}} {\ p \in (\Pi \ ((m \ D)) \ K) \ \leadsto \ p^{\circ}}$

The above rules specify that for one Pi expression to be a subtype of another, then their argument types and body types both have to be subtypes.

Consider the following code to highlight this point:

```racket
(define fn (the (Pi ((n Nat) (fk (Pi ((t Nat)) (U (add1 (add1 t)))))) (U (add1 (add1 n))))
                (lambda(m s) (s m))))
(define subfunc (the (Pi ((v Nat)) (U (add1 v)))
                     (lambda(g) (U g))))
(fn (add1 zero) subfunc)
```
Though `fk` is a `(Pi ((t Nat)) (U (add1 (add1 t))))` its still possible to pass in the function `subfunc` of type 

`(Pi ((v Nat)) (U (add1 v)))` Notice that after a consistent renaming of variables, (U (add1 v)) can be compared to (U (add1 (add1 t))) even though v and t are both neutral.

Functions such as ind-Nat, ind-List and ind-Vec have also been modified to facilitate for these higher types. In the case of ind-List for example, this means that for a motive it must be the case that 
$motive \in (\Pi ((xs \ (List \ E))) \ (U \ infty))$, so proofs using supertypes of $(U zero)$ (which replaces U in Pie) can be done with ind-List in this language. Similarly in ind-Nat, $motive \in (\Pi ((xs \ Nat)) \ (U \ infty))$. 

Consider the following code with ind-Nat:

```racket
(define elevator (the (Pi ((n Nat) (k (U zero))) (U (add1 n)))
                      (lambda(x z)
                        (ind-Nat x
                                 (the (Pi ((k Nat)) (U (add1 (add1 k))))
                                      (lambda(t) (U (add1 t))))
                                 z
                                 (the (Pi ((p Nat) (almost (U (add1 p)))) (U (add1 (add1 p))))
                                      (lambda(r b) b))))))
```
The above code addresses the issue that a function such as `(Pi ((k Nat)) (U (add1 k)))` cannot return a `(U zero)` even though logically `(U zero)` should be a `(U (add1 t))` for any Nat value t. 

The subtyping rules prevent one from declaring that `(U zero)` $\subset$ `(U (add1 t))` because of course, its impossible for us to derive this by applying the rule (U n) $\subset$ (U (add1 n)) any number of times, since k in the expression (U (add1 k)) is neutral. 

`elevator` essentially leverages this more flexible motive type in order to create a function which accepts a expression of type `(U zero)` and returns the same expression but with type `(U (add1 n))` for any Nat `n`.
